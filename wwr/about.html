            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>As we sit here on our porch, watching the gentle flow of the river that has been a backdrop to our lives, we can't help but reflect on the adventure that led us here. It was many summers ago, with our hair not yet touched by the silver of time, that we found ourselves enchanted by the untamed beauty of this river. It whispered to us of hidden places and secret paths, urging us to explore its depths and mysteries. With little more than a couple of old rafts, a shared dream, and a spirit of adventure, we launched our rafting company</p>
            <img src="images/old-couple-rafting-paddles-selfie-standing-riverside-bed.jpeg" alt="Our History">
            <p>We wanted others to feel the thrill of the rapids, the peace of the still waters, and the camaraderie that only comes when you face nature together. What began as a modest endeavor, with just us guiding every trip, has grown beyond our wildest dreams. Yet, at its heart, our company remains a testament to a love for the river and the bonds it forges among those who navigate its waters.</p>
